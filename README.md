**Introduction:**

Education plays a significant role in the success of venture capital-backed startups. Understanding the relationship between educational variables and the achievement of unicorn status (startups valued at least $1 billion) can provide valuable insights for investors and entrepreneurs. In this analysis, we explore a unique dataset that focuses on the educational backgrounds of founders associated with unicorn companies.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the impact of education-based variables on the success of venture capital-backed startups. Specifically, we aim to identify any unusual or nonsensical observations in the data and explore the concept of university homophily among unicorn founders.
