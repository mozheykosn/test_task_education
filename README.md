**Introduction:**

Education plays a significant role in the success of venture capital-backed startups. Understanding the relationship between educational variables and the achievement of unicorn status (startups valued at least $1 billion) can provide valuable insights for investors and entrepreneurs. In this analysis, we explore a unique dataset that focuses on the educational backgrounds of founders associated with unicorn companies.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the impact of education-based variables on the success of venture capital-backed startups. Specifically, we aim to identify any unusual or nonsensical observations in the data and explore the concept of university homophily among unicorn founders.

**Tasks:**
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Education data analysis:
        - Observations / outcomes that are unusual / do not make common sense?
        - What % of unicorns have at least 2 founders who studied at the same university.
        - Number of companies by the number of founders
        - The most popular universities among the founders of unicorn companies
        - The share of unicorn founders in each university
        - The number of educational degrees obtained by founders of unicorn companies

**Conclusion**
In summary, the analysis of the dataset reveals interesting patterns in the education background of unicorn company founders. The majority of companies have 2-5 founders, and there is a notable presence of university homophily among companies with 5, 4, 6, and 7 founders. However, companies with 3 and 2 founders exhibit lower occurrences of university homophily, which aligns with the expectation of fewer shared educational experiences. Additionally, companies with 8 and 9 founders show less inclination towards university homophily, but the limited data points prevent drawing definitive conclusions for this group.

The most commonly attended universities by founders of unicorn companies include Stanford University, MIT, UC Berkeley, Harvard University, and Harvard Business School. However, when compared to another dataset, there are slight variations in the rankings, with universities like Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pennsylvania also appearing in the top 5.

The analysis also highlights the diversity in the number of degrees obtained by founders, with 2 degrees being the most common, followed by 1 degree and then 3 degrees. It is worth noting the presence of unique individuals who have obtained an unusually high number of degrees, ranging from 11 to 13.

These findings shed light on the educational backgrounds of unicorn company founders and provide insights into the prevalence of university homophily and the distribution of degree counts. Such information can be valuable for understanding the dynamics of successful entrepreneurial ventures and the role of education in their formation.
